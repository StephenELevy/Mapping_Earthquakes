# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Module 13 Challenge Summary

## Deliverables 1, 2, & 3 are contained in the Challenge_logic.js and
## index.html files, which are located in the Earthquake_Challenge folder
## of the Mapping_Earthquakes repository.

* The Streets, Satellite, and Dark tile layers can be displayed as map backgrounds.
* The tectonic framework can be toggled on and off the map.
* All of the earthquakes from the past 7 days can be toggled on and off the map.
* The earthquakes with magnitudes >= 4.5 can also be toggle on and off the map.


## The color scales were NOT adjusted for the AllEarthquakes or Earthquake >= 4.5 mag. overlays.
## The color scale for the index scale was not adjusted, and coincides with the color scale of the overlays.

    * The narrow band of earthquake colors for the 4.5 earthquake corresponds to a narrow range of magnitudes.
    * The wide band of earthquake colors for the AllEarthquakes overlay corresponds to a broad range of magnitudes.


##  The bands of high earquake activity correspond to convergent plate boundaries - west coasts of N. & S. America.
##  The plate band in the Japan Area also show high earthquake activity (Fukushima tsunamis induced by earthquake).
##  The divergent plate boundaries in the central & north Atlantic Sea do not show high earthquake activity.

    * Note that the config.js file are not included in submittal as per challenge instructions.
